Create a Database Schema

User Management: The system should support user registration, authentication, and authorization to handle user-specific data such as blog posts, comments, and user profiles.

Blog Posts: The database structure should accommodate storing and retrieving blog posts, including attributes like title, content, publication date, author information, categories, tags, and any associated media files.

Comments and Interactions: It's important to design a structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of comments on blog posts, including attributes like comment content, publication date, author information, and any replies or interactions.

Categories and Tags: The database should support categorizing blog posts into different categories for easy organization and allow the use of tags to enhance discoverability and topic-based filtering of blog posts.

Media Storage: The structure should consider storing and associating media files such as images, videos, or documents with blog posts, allowing for efficient retrieval and management of multimedia content.

User Profiles: The database should store user profiles, including information like username, bio, profile picture, social media links, and any other relevant user details.

Search Functionality: Consider incorporating a search feature that enables users to search for blog posts based on keywords, tags, categories, or specific criteria, ensuring efficient querying and retrieval of relevant content.

Scalability and Performance: The structure should be designed to handle a high volume of concurrent users, large data sets, and frequent read and write operations, ensuring optimal performance, responsiveness, and scalability as the platform grows.

Data Integrity and Security: Implement measures to ensure data integrity, such as enforcing constraints, avoiding data duplication, and implementing appropriate security measures like encryption and user access controls to protect user data
