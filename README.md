# Website Assignment

Here are some of the difficulties I faced while trying to replicate the website.

1. The Arch above Subscribe to email section was not doable.
2. I was not able to put Login Button and Signup at the last section of webpage in Responsive Screen size.
3. Changing the section of Ports and List (denoted by class alllist) was not converted in Compressed list which was showing as similar to dropdown-list in the main webpage
   below Subscribe to email Id.
4. The login button at the top is not exactly same.(I tried various stuff but was not able to do it.)
5. Was not able to put correct cross mark over the Notification Icon.
6. Did not include any script since it was not asked.
7. Changing colour of titlebar from red to white while we scroll down was something I could not understand.
8. The Logo of Cogoport on the titlebar was taken as screenshot instread of typing it out.
   Since I decided to not copy anything from the home website.
9. The whatsapp float icon does exist throughout the page instead of appearing just after banner section.
10. Dropdown list of Mobile Extension number on the Whatsapp section in the banner was confusing.
11. Dropdown list of Nav Bar was not also difficult.
12. The Grid of Industries as well as Our Products sections do not match the intended. I was not able to
    do it in exact manner.
